Echo Nattinger for CAPP 30239

## Project Description
This project aims to provide a dynamic, visual representation of the prevalence of hate crimes across the United States. Specifically, the goal is to see how different marginalized populations suffer greater rates of violence in certain areas. Users can not only choose which victim populations to visualize on the map, but can also click on individual states to learn more. As the user makes choices, the map and screen will adjust to the new populations and states selected.
